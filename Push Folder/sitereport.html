      <h1>Week 1: Index</h1>
      <h2>My first week was getting to grips with using html mostly. Although I have been doing computing for 4 years I have never done anything with either html or css. My main accomplishment was using google fonts to set out the style, and set the design for my website.</h2>

      <image class = img id = mainpic src="index css.png" alt = "Index Screenshot" width = 100></image>
      <h1>Week 2: CV</h1>
      <h2>Week 2 I worked on my CV. Similarly to how I used hover effects for my Navigation bar, I used hover effects to show each institution in my cv links to the website, and then I linked the website, and used anchor tags to make each link clickable.</h2>
      <image class = img id = mainpic src="cv.png" alt = "CV Screenshot" width = 450></image>
      <image class = img id = mainpic src="cv css.png" alt = "CV Screenshot" width = 200></image>
      <h1>Week 3: Contact</h1>
      <h2>This week was the contact page. This was generally straight forward and I learnt how to use a text field tag. So I implemented a fade effect for each page in css, so when the pages open they fade in which makes it feel so much smoother. I also decided to go from a plain black background to a .gif.</h2>
      <image class = img id = mainpic src="contact.png" alt = "Contact Screenshot" width = 550></image>
      <image class = img id = mainpic src="contact css.png" alt = "Contact screenshot" width = 200></image>
      <h1>Week 4: Portfolio</h1>
      <h2>Portfolio was a simple page to implement, as for now we are only using placeholders as next term, we will be making some stuff to put in there. As such I used a royalty free coding image as a background and added a hover effect to make the text larger when you go over it.</h2>
      <image class = img id = mainpic src="portfolio.png" alt = "Portfolio Screenshot" width = 600></image>
      <image class = img id = mainpic src="portfolio css.png" alt = "Portfolio Screenshot" width = 500></image>
      <h1>Week 5: Responsiveness</h1>
      <h2>I brought it all together and made the page responsive. Iâ€™m using @media only to detect when the browser goes below a certain amount of pixels, one at 700 pixels which just makes the font slightly smaller, to then 500 pixels where the navigation bar is changed to fit the page and items are reorganised.</h2>
      <image class = img id = mainpic class = img id = mainpic src="resp.png" alt = "Responsiveness Screenshot" width = 600></image>
      <image class = img id = mainpic src="responsive css.png" alt = "Responsiveness Screenshot" width = 500></image>
      <h1>Week 6: Portfolio</h1>
      <h2>Lastly, I compiled a summery of all the things I have done into roughly just over 300 words, along with screenshots I took along the way, and put them here!</h2>
      <image class = img id = mainpic class = img id = mainpic src="experience.png" alt = "Experience Screenshot" width = 600></image>
